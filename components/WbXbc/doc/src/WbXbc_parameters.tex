\section{Integration Parameters}
\label{param}

This section specifies the integration parameters to configure the WbXbc components.
Each WbXbc component supports a subset of the parameters listed below.

\begin{description}[style=nextline]

\item[\texttt{ITR\_CNT}]
The number of initiator bus interfaces to be offered by the WbXbc component

\item[\texttt{TGT\_CNT}] 
The number of target bus interfaces to be offered by the WbXbc component

\item[\texttt{ADR\_WIDTH}] 
Width of all address busses (\texttt{ADR\_I} and \texttt{ADR\_0})

\item[\texttt{ITR\_ADR\_WIDTH}] 
Width of the initiator address bus(ses) (\texttt{ADR\_I}), in case it differs
from the target address bus(es) (\texttt{ADR\_O}) 

\item[\texttt{SEL\_WIDTH}] 
Number data select lines of all initiator and target busses
(\texttt{SEL\_I} and \texttt{SEL\_O})  

\item[\texttt{ITR\_SEL\_WIDTH}] 
Number of data select lines of the initiator bus (\texttt{SEL\_I}), in case it
from the target bus (\texttt{SEL\_O}) 

\item[\texttt{DAT\_WIDTH}] 
Width of all data busses (initiator and target, read and write direction) 

\item[\texttt{ITR\_DAT\_WIDTH}] 
Width of the initiator's data busses (read and write direction

\item[\texttt{TGA\_WIDTH}] 
Number of tags associated with the address busses of the initiator and
the target (\texttt{TGA\_I} and \texttt{TGA\_O}) 

\item[\texttt{TGC\_WIDTH}] 
Number of tags associated with the cycle indicators (\texttt{CYC\_I} and \texttt{CYC\_O}) of
thw initiator and the target (\texttt{TGC\_I} and \texttt{TGC\_O})

\item[\texttt{TGRD\_WIDTH}] 
Number of tags assoociated with the read data busses of the initiator and
the target (\texttt{TGD\_O} and \texttt{TGD\_I}) 

\item[\texttt{TGWD\_WIDTH}] 
Number of tags associated with the write data busses of the initiator and
the target (\texttt{TGD\_I} and \texttt{TGD\_O}) 

\item[\texttt{BIG\_ENDIAN}] 
Selects the endianess of the design (1=big endian, 0=little endian)

\end{description}
